# LogitechLEDSS
Current version : 1.0

This is a MFC Application to display Sound spectrum(Something like "waving thing" in your mp3 player, you know?) in Logitech Keyboard.(I'm using G810)

Yeah It's useless. I just made this for my hobby.

Anyway, I didn't care about bugs with other environment while developing. So if you have some trouble with this, please fix yourself.

And don't blame me with my codes. I know my codes are suck.

If you want to use without build, just execute bin/EQLED.exe. and if you wanna move directory, don't forget bass.dll.

Libs:
BASS pre-built Library  2.4.13.8
Logitech LED SDK        8.87
